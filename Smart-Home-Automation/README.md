# Smart Home Application with AI Command Processing

This project is a simple smart home application that has been created to allow users control and monitor lights, fans, and thermostats using natural language commands processed by Hugging Face Transformers  model.


## Project Structure

- `config.py`: Holds configuration constants (model name, thresholds, default names, etc.).
- `devices.py`: Contains classes for simulating smart home devices (Light, Fan, Thermostat)
- `command_parser.py`: Implements command parsing using a Hugging Face zero-shot classification model (configured via `config.py`).
- `controller.py`: Connects the command parser with device classes and handles command execution (uses settings from `config.py`).
- `main.py`: Provides a command-line interface for user interaction (uses settings from `config.py`).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies (`transformers`, `torch`, `tf-keras`).
- `PROJECT_REPORT.md`: Detailed documentation of the project (formerly `project_report.md`).

## Features

- Control lights (turn ON/OFF)
- Control fans (turn ON/OFF, set speed to LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Control thermostats (set temperature, increase/decrease temperature)
- Query device status (individual or all devices)
- Natural language command processing via Hugging Face Transformers

## Sample Commands and Expected Outputs


Here are some examples of commands to try and the typical responses:

1.  **Command:** `Turn on the living room light`
    **Output:** `Response: The Living Room Light is now ON.`

2.  **Command:** `Set the fan speed to medium`
    **Output:** `Response: The Living Room Fan speed is set to MEDIUM.`

3.  **Command:** `Set the temperature to 25 degrees`
    **Output:** `Response: The Living Room Thermostat is set to 25.0°C.`

4.  **Command:** `What's the fan status?`
    **Output:** `Response: Living Room Fan: ON (Speed: MEDIUM)` _(Assuming it was set previously)_

5.  **Command:** `What is the status of all devices?`
    **Output:**
    ```
    Response: Current Status:
    Living Room Light: ON
    Living Room Fan: ON (Speed: MEDIUM)
    Living Room Thermostat: 25.0°C
    ```
    _(Note: Actual status will depend on previous commands)_

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed.
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    _(Note:  The first time you run the application, the Hugging Face model will be downloaded, which might take  some time depending on your internet connection.)
3.  Navigate to the project directory.
4.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
5.  Enter commands at the prompt (e.g., `Turn off the fan`, `exit`).

## Testing

(Test file `test.py` was removed as part of cleanup.)

## Configuration

Key settings like the Hugging Face model name, classification confidence threshold, and default device names can be adjusted in the `config.py` file.

## Possible Future Enhancements

- More sophisticated NLP models or fine-tuning for better accuracy.
- Handling more complex commands or conversation context.
- Additional device types
- User interface
- Voice input capabilities
- Scheduling and automation features
- Authentification
