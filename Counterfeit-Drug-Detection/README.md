# Counterfeit Drug Detection System



## Overview

The Counterfeit Drug Detection System uses machine learning to identify counterfeit medications through computer vision techniques. Our EfficientNetB0-based Model 2 analyzes multiple factors simultaneously:

- Drug packaging features (logos, fonts, color schemes, and holograms)
- Visual characteristics including color consistency, print quality, and physical attributes
- Texture patterns and imprint clarity
- Suspicious text markings and modifications

This approach enables rapid, accessible, and accurate identification of potential counterfeit medications without requiring specialized equipment, making it suitable for use by healthcare providers, pharmacists, regulatory agencies, and even consumers.

## Key Features

- **EfficientNetB0 Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained image recognition capabilities
- **High Performance in Real-world Conditions**: 95% overall accuracy with 99.7% authentic recall
- **Fast Processing**: 76ms per image analysis time
- **Advanced Synthetic Generation**: Five specialized counterfeit simulation techniques
- **User-friendly Interface**: Gradio-based web UI with detailed visual explanations
- **Error Handling**: Recovery mechanisms for corrupted images and processing errors
- **Feature-specific Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of suspicious visual elements

## System Architecture

Our implementation employs a modular architecture with five main components:

1. **Data Analysis**: Analyzes dataset composition with recursive image discovery and corrupted file detection
2. **Image Recognition Module**: Processes and analyzes visual features using transfer learning with pre-trained EfficientNetB0
3. **Modeling Pipeline**: Two-phase training (11-epoch initial training followed by 10-epoch fine-tuning) with comprehensive metrics tracking
4. **Evaluation System**: Detailed performance visualization with feature importance analysis
5. **Gradio Interface**: Interactive user interface with confidence visualization and mode transparency

## Dataset

The system was trained and evaluated using a carefully curated dataset:

1. **Authentic Images (8,469 samples)**:

   - NIH/NLM Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification (C3PI): High-quality reference images
   - DailyMed: FDA-approved medication information and images
   - NLM20: National Library of Medicine pharmaceutical dataset

2. **Counterfeit Images (999 samples)**:
   - Synthetically generated using five complementary simulation techniques:
     - **Color Shift**: Modifies hue and saturation to simulate color differences
     - **Noise Addition**: Adds random noise to simulate lower quality printing
     - **Blur Application**: Applies Gaussian blur to simulate poor focus
     - **Contrast/Brightness Adjustment**: Modifies image lighting attributes
     - **Fake Text Overlay**: Adds simulated text markings

The dataset maintains a balanced class ratio of 8.48:1 (authentic to counterfeit), which reflects realistic pharmaceutical market conditions.

## Model Performance

Our EfficientNetB0-based model demonstrates strong performance on a realistic, imbalanced dataset:

| Metric                | Performance |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Overall Accuracy      | 95%         |
| Authentic Precision   | 95.1%       |
| Authentic Recall      | 99.7%       |
| Counterfeit Precision | 95.8%       |
| Counterfeit Recall    | 56.5%       |
| F1-Score              | 95%         |
| AUC-ROC               | 0.935       |
| Training Time         | 1.5 hours   |
| Inference Time/Image  | 76ms        |

The high authentic recall (99.7%) is particularly valuable in pharmaceutical contexts, minimizing disruption to legitimate supply chains. While counterfeit recall is lower (56.5%), this represents a reasonable trade-off in real-world conditions where false positives would be highly problematic.

## Technical Highlights

Our implementation provides several technical advantages:

1. **EfficientNetB0-based Transfer Learning**:

   - Pre-trained ImageNet weights providing excellent feature extraction capabilities
   - Two-phase training approach: 11-epoch initial training followed by 10-epoch fine-tuning

2. **Speed Optimizations**:

   - Parallel preprocessing pipeline
   - 40% reduction in memory utilization
   - Recursive image discovery with intelligent filtering
   - Advanced error recovery mechanisms

3. **Robust Data Handling**:

   - Validates images before processing to prevent errors
   - Automatically finds images across nested directory structures
   - Supports multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP)

4. **Detailed Visualization**:
   - Feature importance analysis showing focus on text/imprint quality (35%)
   - Detailed breakdown of key authentication factors
   - Clear indication of model operation mode
   - Graphical confidence visualization
